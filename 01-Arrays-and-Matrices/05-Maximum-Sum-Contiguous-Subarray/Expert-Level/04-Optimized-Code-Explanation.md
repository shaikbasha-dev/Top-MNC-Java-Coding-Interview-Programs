# Optimized Code Explanation — Maximum Sum Contiguous Subarray

## Complete Expert Program

```java
public class MaximumSumContiguousSubarray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4};
        int currentSum = numbers[0];
        int maximumSum = numbers[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            currentSum = Math.max(numbers[i], currentSum + numbers[i]);
            maximumSum = Math.max(maximumSum, currentSum);
        }

        System.out.println("Maximum Sum = " + maximumSum);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Line 1
```java
public class MaximumSumContiguousSubarray {
