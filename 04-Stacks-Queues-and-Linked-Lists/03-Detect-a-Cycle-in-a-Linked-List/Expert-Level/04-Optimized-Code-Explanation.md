## Expert Explanation

The expert solution focuses on the invariant that makes the operation efficient.

### What to Explain

1. What each pointer or data structure represents.
2. Why each movement is safe.
3. How the loop terminates.
4. Why the final state is the answer.
5. Why the stated complexity is achieved.
