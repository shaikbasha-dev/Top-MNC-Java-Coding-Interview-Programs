# 10 — Beginner-Friendly Code Explanation

## Complete Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GridPaths {
    static void findPaths(int row, int col, int rows, int cols, String path) {
        if (row == rows - 1 && col == cols - 1) {
            System.out.println(path);
            return;
        }

        if (row < rows - 1) {
            findPaths(row + 1, col, rows, cols, path + "D");
        }

        if (col < cols - 1) {
            findPaths(row, col + 1, rows, cols, path + "R");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        findPaths(0, 0, 2, 3, "");
    }
}
```

## Line-by-Line Beginner Explanation

- The class contains the complete solution.
- `main()` creates the starting input.
- The recursive method receives the current state.
- The base case answers the question: **“Have we completed one valid solution?”**
- If not, the program tries one possible choice.
- The recursive call means: **“Now solve the remaining smaller problem.”**
- After returning, the program undoes the choice.
- This undo operation is the heart of backtracking.
- The loop tries the next possible choice.
- The process continues until all valid branches are explored.

### Easy Way to Remember

**Choose → Explore → Undo → Choose another.**
