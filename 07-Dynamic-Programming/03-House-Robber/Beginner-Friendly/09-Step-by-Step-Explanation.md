## Complete Program

```java
public class HouseRobber {
    static int rob(int[] money) {
        if (money.length == 0) return 0;
        if (money.length == 1) return money[0];

        int[] dp = new int[money.length];
        dp[0] = money[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(money[0], money[1]);

        for (int i = 2; i < money.length; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + money[i]);
        }

        return dp[money.length - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] money = {2, 7, 9, 3, 1};
        System.out.println("Maximum amount = " + rob(money));
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Program Explanation

1. **Class and method setup:** Java defines the class and required methods.
2. **Input setup:** The sample input is created in `main()`.
3. **DP state creation:** The required one-dimensional or two-dimensional DP structure is created.
4. **Base-case initialization:** Known answers are stored first.
5. **State transition:** Each new state is calculated from smaller previously solved states.
6. **Choice comparison:** Where alternatives exist, the required minimum, maximum, or boolean result is selected.
7. **Final state:** The state representing the complete problem contains the answer.
8. **Output:** The final answer is printed.
