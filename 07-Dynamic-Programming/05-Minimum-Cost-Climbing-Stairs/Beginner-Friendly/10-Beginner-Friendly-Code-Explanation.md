## Complete Code

```java
public class MinimumCostClimbingStairs {
    static int minCost(int[] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(
                dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1],
                dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]
            );
        }

        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] cost = {10, 15, 20};
        System.out.println("Minimum cost = " + minCost(cost));
    }
}

## Beginner-Friendly Explanation

Think of the DP array or table as a notebook.

- Each `dp` position represents one smaller question.
- First, write the answers that are already known.
- Calculate the next answer using the answers already written.
- Because those smaller answers are stored, the same subproblem is not solved repeatedly.
- `for` loops move through the states in the required order.
- `Math.max()` is useful when the problem asks for the best/largest choice.
- `Math.min()` is useful when the problem asks for the cheapest/smallest choice.
- A boolean DP table stores whether a target is possible.
- A two-dimensional table is used when two changing values define the state.

### Easy Way to Remember

**DP = Store Small Answers → Reuse Them → Build the Big Answer**
