    static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];

                        dp[i][w],
                        values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]

        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;

## Beginner-Friendly Explanation

Think of the DP array or table as a notebook.

- Each `dp` position represents one smaller question.
- First, write the answers that are already known.
- Calculate the next answer using the answers already written.
- Because those smaller answers are stored, the same subproblem is not solved repeatedly.
- `for` loops move through the states in the required order.
- `Math.max()` is useful when the problem asks for the best/largest choice.
- `Math.min()` is useful when the problem asks for the cheapest/smallest choice.
- A boolean DP table stores whether a target is possible.
- A two-dimensional table is used when two changing values define the state.

### Easy Way to Remember

**DP = Store Small Answers → Reuse Them → Build the Big Answer**
