# 11 — Dry Run

## Complete Program

```java
public class Knapsack01 {
    static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];

                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(
                        dp[i][w],
                        values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]
                    );
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        int capacity = 7;

        System.out.println("Maximum value = "
                + knapsack(weights, values, capacity));
    }
}
```

## Dry Run — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Input

```text
weights = [1,3,4,5], values = [1,4,5,7], capacity = 7
```

### Step 2 — Create DP State

The required array or table is created.

### Step 3 — Initialize Base States

States whose answers are already known are filled first.

### Step 4 — Calculate Next State

The algorithm uses previous states according to the transition rule.

### Step 5 — Continue Filling

Each state is calculated from smaller states until the complete input has been processed.

### Step 6 — Final State

The final state represents the answer to the original problem.

### Final Result

```text
Maximum value = 9
```
